Measures of Central Tendency,"Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that identify a single value as representative of an entire dataset. The three most common measures are mean, median, and mode. The mean is the average value, the median is the middle value when the data is ordered, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value. Each measure has its strengths and weaknesses, particularly in how they are affected by extreme values in the dataset.",Which measure of central tendency is least affected by extreme values?,Median,Easy,Beginner,General,0.3,No Prerequisites,2.0,Geography,12

"Applicability of Mean, Median, and Mode","Mean, median, and mode are three different measures of central tendency used in statistics. Each has its own applicability based on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the analysis. Mean is the average value of a dataset, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. It is useful for understanding the overall trend of the data but can be influenced by extreme values. Median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order. It is less affected by extreme values and is particularly useful when the data is skewed or has outliers. Mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is useful for identifying the most common occurrence but may not be meaningful in datasets with continuous variables or multiple modes. Each measure has its merits and demerits. Mean provides a comprehensive average but can be skewed by outliers. Median gives a central value that is robust to outliers but may not represent the overall trend well. Mode is simple to understand and useful for categorical data but may not exist or be unique in some datasets.",What are the three measures of central tendency?,"Mean, median, and mode.",Easy,Beginner,General,0.225,No Prerequisites,2.0,Geography,12
