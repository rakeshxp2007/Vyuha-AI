Conclusion
Seismic waves act as natural probes into Earth’s interior. Their study not only enhances scientific understanding of Earth’s structure but also strengthens earthquake forecasting, hazard assessment, and disaster preparedness."
Discuss the phenomenon of geomagnetic reversal and elucidate its causes. (10 Marks),"Geomagnetic reversal refers to the periodic interchange of the Earth’s magnetic north and south poles. Paleomagnetic studies of igneous rocks show that such reversals have occurred repeatedly over geological time at irregular intervals, typically spanning hundreds of thousands of years.
Phenomenon
•	The Earth’s magnetic field is generated by the geodynamo mechanism, involving convection of molten iron and nickel in the liquid outer core.
•	During a reversal, the magnetic field weakens, becomes unstable, and eventually re-establishes with opposite polarity.
•	Reversals are gradual processes, taking thousands of years to complete.
Causes
•	Changes in convection currents and flow patterns within the outer core disrupt the geodynamo.
•	Core–mantle boundary variations in heat flow and composition affect magnetic field stability.
•	Possible influence of mantle plumes and thermal anomalies altering core dynamics.
•	Long-term geodynamic cycles may govern the timing of reversals.
Significance
Geomagnetic reversals provide insights into Earth’s interior and have implications for navigation systems, satellite operations, and migratory species."
"Geomorphic processes bring changes to the surface of the earth. In this context, discuss the types of endogenic geomorphic processes. (15 Marks)","Geomorphic processes are natural forces that shape and modify the Earth’s surface. Based on their source of energy, they are classified into endogenic (internal) and exogenic (external) processes. Endogenic geomorphic processes originate from the Earth’s interior and are driven by geothermal energy and tectonic forces.
Types of Endogenic Geomorphic Processes

1. Diastrophic Movements
These are slow, long-term crustal movements responsible for large-scale landform development.
•	Epeirogenic movements:
o	Broad, vertical uplift or subsidence of large crustal blocks.
o	Lead to formation of plateaus, basins, and continental masses without intense deformation.
•	Orogenic movements:
o	Horizontal compressional forces acting along narrow belts.
o	Result in folding, faulting, and mountain building, producing ranges like fold mountains.
2. Sudden Movements
These occur abruptly and release accumulated energy, often causing destruction.
•	Earthquakes:
o	Sudden release of energy along faults due to plate movements.
o	Cause ground shaking, fissures, uplift, subsidence, and valley formation.
•	Volcanism:
o	Upward movement of magma leading to surface eruptions.
o	Forms volcanic landforms such as cones, lava plateaus, and calderas.
Significance
Endogenic processes are fundamental in shaping the primary relief features of the Earth and play a crucial role in understanding tectonics, natural hazards, and long-term landscape evolution.
Conclusion:
Endogenic geomorphic processes represent the internal dynamism of the Earth, continuously transforming its surface and influencing both physical geography and human activity.

"Volcanoes play a significant role in shaping the Earth’s surface and impacting the environment and human society. In this context, delineate the geological processes and factors that lead to volcanic eruptions. (15 Marks)","Volcanoes are surface expressions of internal geodynamic processes and play a crucial role in shaping the Earth’s surface while significantly influencing the environment and human society.
Geological Processes and Factors Leading to Volcanic Eruptions
1. Plate Tectonics
•	Divergent plate boundaries: Plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and form mid-ocean ridges and shield volcanoes.
•	Convergent plate boundaries: Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental or oceanic plate leads to melting and formation of volcanic arcs.
•	Transform boundaries: Volcanism is rare but may occur where deep fractures facilitate magma ascent.
2. Hotspots
•	Volcanic activity caused by mantle plumes independent of plate boundaries, producing linear volcanic chains.
3. Magma Composition
•	Basaltic magma: Low viscosity, results in effusive eruptions.
•	Andesitic and rhyolitic magma: High viscosity, traps gases, causing explosive eruptions.
4. Gas Content
•	Dissolved gases such as water vapour, CO_, and SO_ expand rapidly as magma ascends, triggering eruptions.
5. Magma Chamber Pressure
•	Accumulation of magma increases pressure, fracturing surrounding rocks and forcing magma to the surface.
Role and Impact of Volcanism
•	Shapes landforms such as cones, calderas, lava plateaus, and islands.
•	Affects climate and air quality through ash and aerosols.
•	Causes hazards like lava flows, ashfall, and lahars impacting human settlements.
Conclusion

"Do we have cultural pockets of small India all over the nation? Elaborate with examples. (10 Marks, 150 words)","Yes, India has several “cultural pockets of small India” spread across the country, where regional cultures are preserved and practised outside their original geographical locations. This reflects India’s pluralistic and integrative social fabric.
Migration for employment, education, marriage, and trade has led to the formation of such pockets—for example, Tamil and Telugu communities in Bengaluru, Punjabi settlements in Delhi, North-Eastern communities in metropolitan cities, and Marwari business communities across urban India.
Metropolitan cities act as cultural melting pots where diverse languages, cuisines, festivals, and customs coexist, creating miniature versions of India within neighbourhoods and housing societies.
Educational institutions attract students nationwide, fostering cultural exchange through shared living, festivals, and everyday interaction.
Festivals, cuisine, dress, and art forms transcend regional boundaries—Durga Puja in Delhi, Onam in Mumbai, or Bihu celebrations in Pune illustrate this spread.
Media, travel, and digital platforms further accelerate cultural diffusion.
Thus, these cultural pockets strengthen unity in diversity, reinforcing national integration without erasing regional identities."
"Why is there a strengthening of the caste system? Discuss the recent changes in the caste system in India along with the suitable example. (15 Marks, 250 words)","Despite constitutional guarantees of equality, caste has shown renewed salience in contemporary India, adapting itself to democratic politics, economic change, and social mobilisation rather than disappearing.
Why is the Caste System Strengthening?
•	Caste-based politics: Political mobilisation around caste identities for vote consolidation has reinforced caste consciousness. Parties often select candidates and frame agendas on caste arithmetic (e.g., OBC or Dalit-based parties).
•	Reservation and affirmative action: While corrective in intent, caste-based reservations require continued identification by caste, sometimes reinforcing group boundaries.
•	Caste associations and panchayats: Caste organisations and informal caste councils regulate marriage, behaviour, and social norms, sustaining caste authority.
•	Economic inequalities: Persistent disparities in education, land ownership, and employment keep caste identities relevant as survival and bargaining tools.
•	Social discrimination: Practices like untouchability, endogamy, and honour-based sanctions still exist in parts of rural India, strengthening caste hierarchies.
Recent Changes in the Caste System
•	Economic and social mobility: Urbanisation, education, and non-farm employment have enabled many from lower castes to improve socio-economic status.
•	Rise of a cross-caste middle class: Consumption patterns and professional identities increasingly cut across caste lines.
•	Education and employment diversification: Reservations in higher education and public employment have weakened traditional occupational rigidity.
•	Inter-caste marriages: Though limited, they are rising, especially in urban and educated sections.
•	Urban anonymity: In cities, caste is often less visible, replaced by class and occupation.
Conclusion
Thus, caste in India is not static but dynamic—simultaneously reinforced through politics and social practices, yet diluted by education, urbanisation, and economic change. The challenge lies in reducing caste-based inequality without perpetuating caste identity itself."
